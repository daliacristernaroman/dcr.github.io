We present Spreadsheet-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning framework designed to build specialized spreadsheet agents capable of managing complex tasks. We evaluate Spreadsheet-RL on SpreadSheetBench and domain-specific benchmarks, demonstrating that it helps open-source models improve by 40%, and approach weak commercial model performance, reaching the performance of OpenAI o3.
